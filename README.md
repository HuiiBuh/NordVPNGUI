# NordVPNGui - Not Working

The webinterface of the Python NordVPN client.
It is based on the design of the desktop Client in Windows.
It will only work combined with the [NordVPN project in python](https://github.com/HuiiBuh/NordVPN). Look there for installation instructions.

Up to now you can only connect to servers, the settings are not jet connected to the python backend. There will not be an option to show the special servers like the servers optimized for P2P, DoubeVPN ...
